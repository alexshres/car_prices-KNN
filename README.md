# Predicting Car Prices using k-Nearest Neighbors method


The data set we will be working with contains information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more. You can read more about the data set [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile).

We will use k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict car prices. First I will implement my own version of k-Nearest Neighbors and afterwards, use the scikit-learn library's version of k-Nearest Neighbors to predict with both univariate and multivariate models.
